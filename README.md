# amazonMarketSQL
In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

install the proper npms and type in node bamazonManager.js or node bamazonCustomer.js for the grids to show up so you can figure out what to do with each individual item.
